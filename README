Vibrator Belt. 
Copyright 2016, Thomas TEMPE

The purpose of this project is to build a (physical) vibrating belt as a tool for sensory augmentation.
The belt is fitted with coin vibrators along its length. The one that points north vibrates at all time.
Use it continuously for 6 weeks, and you will grow a sense of direction. Take it off, and you will experience amputation.

The control board uses an ATMega32u4 at 8MHz.
To get it running:
* Install the Arduino IDE from Arduino.cc. Run it once, then quit it.
* Copy Arduino/*/ into your Documents/Arduino directory
* solder an 8MHz external oscillator on the back of the control board
* Start the Arduino IDE. Select Tools->Board: -> Atmega32u4 on a breadboard (8MHz internal clock)
* Connect the ISP connector to an ISP programmer. Select the proper port in Tools->Port
* Click Tools->burn bootloader
* remove the external oscillator
* Tools->Board:->LilyPad Arduino USB
* File->Examples->01. Basics->Blink
* Click « Upload » on the icon bar. The « Signal » LED should blink with 0.5Hz frequency.
* open code/Compass_band5_leather/compass_band5_leather.ino in Arduino
* Click the « upload » icon on the icon bar. control code should be uploading.
