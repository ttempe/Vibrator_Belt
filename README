Vibrator Belt. 
Copyright 2016, Thomas TEMPE

The purpose of this project is to build a (physical) vibrating belt as a tool for sensory augmentation.
The belt is fitted with coin vibrators along its length. The one that points north vibrates at all time.
Use it continuously for 6 weeks, and you will grow a sense of direction. Take it off, and you will experience amputation.

Code/			Arduino code.


The control board uses an ATMega32u4 at 8MHz.
To get it running:
* solder an 8MHz external oscillator on the back of the control board
* flash the bootloader for 8MHz with internal oscillator
* remove the external oscillator
* Select the « LilyPad Arduino USB » board for flashing the program.
